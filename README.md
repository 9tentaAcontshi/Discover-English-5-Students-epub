## Features and Benefits
     
Discover English 5 Student's Book has the following features and benefits for learners and teachers of English:
     
- It is based on the concept of Big Questions, which are linked to school subjects and form the basis of every unit. The Big Questions encourage students to think critically and creatively about topics such as sport, art, science, culture, and society. For example, some of the Big Questions in Discover English 5 Student's Book are: How do we measure time? What makes a good story? How do we communicate with animals? How do we protect our planet?
- It provides authentic fiction and non-fiction texts on every topic, which expose students to different views and genres of writing. The texts are carefully selected and graded to match the level and interests of the students. For example, some of the texts in Discover English 5 Student's Book are: a biography of Albert Einstein, a newspaper article about a triathlon champion, a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, and a blog post about recycling.
- It uses video clips to introduce each Big Question, which help students activate their prior knowledge and engage their curiosity. The video clips are short and relevant to the topic, and they are accompanied by pre- and post-watching activities that develop students' listening and speaking skills. For example, some of the video clips in Discover English 5 Student's Book are: a documentary about ancient calendars, a trailer for a movie adaptation of The Hobbit, a report about a dolphin rescue project, and an animation about global warming.
- It covers a comprehensive grammar and skills syllabus, which is integrated with the Big Questions and the texts. The grammar points are presented in clear and simple language, with examples and practice exercises. The skills sections focus on reading, writing, listening, speaking, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The skills are taught in a communicative and interactive way, with tasks that require students to use the language in meaningful contexts. For example, some of the skills tasks in Discover English 5 Student's Book are: writing an email to a pen pal, giving a presentation about a famous person, taking part in a debate about animal rights, and reading aloud a poem with expression.
- It offers online practice links that connect the class to the home. The online practice platform provides additional exercises and activities that reinforce what students have learned in class. The online practice also gives students instant feedback and progress reports, which help them monitor their own learning. Teachers can also access the online practice platform to assign homework, track students' performance, and communicate with them.
- It supports students who are preparing for the Cambridge Young Learners English Test (CYLET), which is an internationally recognized exam for young learners of English. The textbook includes a vocabulary syllabus that is linked to the CYLET word list, as well as activities that are similar to the CYLET exam format.

## Challenges and Limitations
     
Discover English 5 Student's Book also has some challenges and limitations that learners and teachers of English should be aware of:

- It may not suit all learning styles and preferences. Some students may find the inquiry-based approach too challenging or too open-ended. They may prefer more guidance and structure in their learning process. Some teachers may also find it difficult to adapt to the inquiry-based approach, especially if they are used to more traditional methods of teaching.
- It may not cover all the topics and skills that students need or want to learn. Some students may have specific interests or goals that are not addressed by the Big Questions or the texts. Some teachers may also have specific curricula or standards that they need to follow or meet. In these cases, they may need to supplement or modify the textbook with other materials or resources.
- It may not be available or accessible in all countries or regions. Some students or teachers may not have access to the Internet or the online practice platform, which limits their learning opportunities and support. Some students or teachers may also not have access to the textbook itself, either because it is too expensive, out of stock, or not distributed in their area.

## Conclusion
     
Discover English 5 Student's Book is a textbook that aims to help students achieve near-native fluency in English by combining a native speaker approach to inquiry-based learning with a controlled grammar and skills syllabus. It has many features and benefits for learners and teachers of English, such as the Big Questions, the authentic texts, the video clips, the online practice, and the CYLET preparation. However, it also has some challenges and limitations, such as the suitability for different learning styles and preferences, the coverage of all the topics and skills, and the availability and accessibility in all countries and regions. Therefore, learners and teachers of English should consider their own needs and goals before choosing Discover English 5 Student's Book as their textbook.
